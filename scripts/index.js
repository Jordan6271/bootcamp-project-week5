Elegant drapes hang lifelessly from rusted rails, which hide heavy iron barred windows. The room has been deprived of all natural light, but an immaculate chandelier hangs from the centre of the high ceiling, providing just enough light that you can vaguely make out the outline of an ornate, golden framed painting on the northern wall of the upper foyer; its subject is difficult to see from this distance. You feel alone in this almost bare expanse.`;
foyer.directions = `Two doors are located on the ground floor, one in the east wall and one to the west. To the north, a grand staircase ascends to the first floor`;

huntingLodge.description = `This room is small and the air is warm. You are briefly soothed by the crackle of coals on the hearth, which to your surprise, is lit! You start to consider this space cosy. That is until you notice dozens of hunting trophies that adorn all four walls; each glassy gaze seeming to follow your every move. An almost lifelike bearskin rug covers the majority of the creaky wooden floorboards. The fire cannot quash the chills that run down your spine.`;

banquetHall.description = `An enormous dinner table resides in the centre of this room full of various aromas. Most are mouth-wateringly good, others strange. You canâ€™t decide if you want to salivate or be sick. Silver platters are laden with gigantic portions of several meats, exotic fruits, and pastries. Everything looks and smells fresh, as if it were cooked just for you. Taking pride of place at the head of the main table is an irresistible looking hog roast. You feel hungry and contemplate whether to eat.`;
banquetHall.directions = `There are three doors in this room, a small door to the north and one to the south. To the west, large glass doors appear to lead to an outside area.`;

kitchen.description = `There is not much space to move. A tiny stove is cluttered with dirty dishes and a cast iron cooking pot, dripping with some unidentifiable liquid. Some juicy looking green apples reside in a woven bowl on the countertop. Wonky wooden shelves hold a few empty jars. The door of a cupboard swings eerily on its last remaining hinge. A draft must be coming from somewhere.`;

Its white marble base has been delicately carved with stunning doves of peace and the water runs crystal clear. A huge oak tree towers over the grounds within the courtyard, close to the seemingly unbreachable northern boundary. Its branches look strong and sturdy. They sway with an almost human-like motion.`;

conservatory.description = `The room is softly lit with natural light piercing through the foggy walls. A quaint, oak side table supports a bowl of ripe red apples. The cold tiled floor has been decorated with dark, damp soil from a smashed flower pot; shards of porcelain are scattered around your feet.  Human-like footprints can be seen heading north within the soil deposit, and you feel a tentative sense of hope that you are not the only person in the manor anymore.`;

The corridor is notably dark; there is just enough light from the glass door to the north to make several unlit torches in holders on the eastern wall visible.`;

You hold his sword, presented as a gift for your admirable victory. The corridor is notably dark; there is just enough light from the glass door to the north to make several unlit torches in holders on the eastern wall visible. You hear soft classical music from behind the western wall.`;

Your footsteps now echo on the polished floorboards and your blood runs cold unexplainably. You feel like you are being watched from every corner. Your attention is drawn suddenly by the sound of sobbing from behind the regal drawstring curtains that fall from the high ceiling down to the floor. Someone sounds in distress. Perhaps they are looking for an exit too?`;
